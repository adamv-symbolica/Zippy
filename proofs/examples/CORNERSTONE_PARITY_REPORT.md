# Cornerstone Backend Parity Report

Status: PASS

This report records executable Scala differential checks. It is not a solver proof: generation fails unless reference, trie, optimized source, zipper, and operation-graph results agree. Counterexample-sensitive symbolic SMT and axiomatized structural-FOL schema checks live under `proofs/open/`; the latter assume backend/source agreement per constructor and are not independent implementation-equivalence proofs.
